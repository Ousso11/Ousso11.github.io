Iâ€™m **Oussama Gabouj**, a Master's student in **Data Science** at **EPFL**, with a **minor in Cyber Security**. My academic journey started in **Microengineering**, where I developed a solid foundation in systems, robotics, and signal processing. Over time, I transitioned toward advanced topics in **Machine Learning**, **Multimodal AI**, and **Secure Systems** â€” driven by a growing passion for building intelligent and trustworthy AI systems.

I am particularly interested in **Multimodal AI** â€” designing systems that seamlessly integrate information from diverse data modalities such as text, images, video, graphs, and audio to enable more robust, context-aware, and generalizable agents. My research explores the **fusion**, **alignment**, and **retrieval** across modalities to construct semantically rich AI pipelines.

Beyond modeling, I am highly motivated by challenges in **evaluation**, **benchmarking**, and **trustworthiness**. This includes defining new performance indicators for multimodal reasoning, analyzing **failure cases**, and ensuring the **security**, **robustness**, and **privacy** of AI systems and datasets â€” especially in real-world, open-set, or adversarial settings.


## Research Experience

I have collaborated with several research laboratories at EPFL, each offering a unique perspective on AI:

- [**Data Science Laboratory (DLab)**](https://dlab.epfl.ch): Focuses on natural language processing, machine learning, computational social science, and network analysis â€” transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

- [**Laboratory of Computational Systems Biotechnology (LCSB)**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcsb/): Operates at the interface of synthetic and systems biology to uncover design principles of biological systems with applications in medicine and biotechnology.

- [**Distributed Intelligent Systems and Algorithms Laboratory (DISAL)**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/disal/): Develops intelligent, distributed cyber-physical systems â€” including multi-robot platforms, mobile sensing systems, and intelligent control algorithms.

Additionally, I gained industry-facing research experience at:

- [**Pixalione (Paris)**](https://www.pixalione.co.uk/): A digital marketing agency with strong R&D in SEO, SEA, and data science, integrating AI models for content strategy and predictive analytics.

- [**AXA Group Operations (Switzerland)**](https://www.axa.com/en/about-us/axa-group-operations): The technology and innovation arm of AXA, leading data and AI projects to optimize operations and develop next-generation insurance services.
