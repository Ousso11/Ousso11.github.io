I‚Äôm **Oussama Gabouj**, a Master's student in **Data Science** at **EPFL** with a **minor in Cyber Security**.  Through various lab collaborations, industrial internships, and courses, I‚Äôve worked on a wide range of **research projects** and **course projects** that I‚Äôm excited to share here. I also maintain a **[Research & Debug Diary](/diary)** ‚Äî a journal documenting technical challenges I‚Äôve faced and how I tackled them, both in research and in code.

- Research Projects: project conducted in collaboration with EPFL labs, either supporting PhD students or independently leading parts of larger projects.

- Publication: Academic work published as an outcome of my research contributions

- Course Projects: Applied technical projects developed during advanced coursework, covering topics across AI, computer vision, robotics, and secure systems.
