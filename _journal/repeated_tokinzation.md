title: "Speeding Up Evaluation with Cached Tokenization"
collection: journal
excerpt: "Avoiding redundant tokenizer calls accelerated validation by up to 3Ã— during fine-tuning."

## Issue

Evaluation during fine-tuning slowed dramatically due to:

- **Repeated tokenizer calls** at each validation step
- **Duplicate pre-processing** even on static evaluation datasets
- Wasted CPU cycles and memory allocation

## Solution

We implemented **tokenization caching** ahead of evaluation:

### 1. Pre-tokenize Static Datasets

- Tokenized all evaluation samples before training
- Saved token IDs using `pickle` or `torch.save` to disk

### 2. Efficient On-Demand Loading

- Loaded tokenized sequences as Tensors or NumPy arrays
- Avoided re-tokenizing already-seen text during eval

## ðŸš€ Outcome

- Evaluation loop speed increased by **2Ã— to 3Ã—**
- **CPU usage dropped**, freeing resources for GPU training
- Enabled faster feedback on validation accuracy

## ðŸ’¡ Takeaway

**Never tokenize the same data twice** during long fine-tunes.  
Pre-tokenizing saves time, memory, and compute â€“ especially on large validation sets.
