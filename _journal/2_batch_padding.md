## Issue

When training on **mixed-length sequences**, dynamic padding causes:

- **Wasted GPU memory** from excessive padding
- **Unstable throughput** due to sequence-length variance
- Slower **token-level processing** in attention-heavy models

This inefficiency was noticeable during large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning runs.

## Solution

We implemented **bucketing** to organize samples by similar length before batching:

### 1. Sort + Bucket Strategy

- Used a **sortish sampler** to roughly group sequences by length (e.g., sentence tokens).
- Applied **batch shuffling** within each bucket to avoid overfitting.
- Integrated with PyTorch `DataLoader` for seamless batching.

### 2. Tools

- `sortish_sampler` (FastAI or custom)
- Native `collate_fn` with sequence padding per bucket

## ðŸš€ Outcome

- **Reduced padding by up to 40â€“60%** in long-sequence tasks
- **Smoothed GPU memory consumption** across epochs
- Boosted throughput by **~1.5Ã—**, especially on large batches

## ðŸ’¡ Takeaway

Sequence bucketing is a simple but powerful optimization for NLP:

- It increases **training speed** and **memory efficiency**
- Essential for **large token models** with highly variable input lengths
