excerpt: "Correctly configuring AMP and autocast led to 2Ã— faster training on NVIDIA GPUs."

## Issue

Despite using **float16** or **bfloat16**, training was not significantly faster.  
Profiling revealed:

- **Tensor Cores underutilized**
- Inconsistent performance across training steps
- Suboptimal memory bandwidth usage

## Solution

We fixed AMP underuse by **enforcing correct mixed-precision behavior**:

### 1. Enable Autocast + GradScaler

- Wrapped forward/backward in `torch.cuda.amp.autocast()`
- Used `GradScaler` to handle loss scaling and overflow detection
- Verified mixed precision was being correctly applied at all layers

### 2. Model & Layer Compliance

- Ensured all model components supported `float16` (e.g., no hard-coded `float32`)
- Disabled layers that defaulted to `float32` manually

## ðŸš€ Outcome

- Training speed increased by **1.3Ã— to 2Ã—** on Ampere/Hopper GPUs
- Lower VRAM usage with **bfloat16** on A100s
- Stable training with **no accuracy drop**

## ðŸ’¡ Takeaway

Mixed precision only helps **if configured correctly**.  
Always validate that your model is **truly using AMP** and that **Tensor Cores are active**.
