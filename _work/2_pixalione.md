## üß† Problem Statement & Motivation

Each client manages one or more Google Ads campaigns with a fixed daily budget. Spending occurs per keyword match and is driven by live auction dynamics, click rates, and impressions. However, most clients lack tools to **anticipate daily trends**, often resulting in inefficient budget use.

Our goal was to create a predictive system that helps clients **understand and control their spending behavior**, improving their ROI by proactively adjusting campaign strategies.

## üîß My Contributions

- Built a robust **machine learning pipeline** to predict daily ad spend using past trends in **click-through rates, impressions, and user profiles**.
- Enabled **per-client budget optimization**, integrating live forecasts into business logic.
- Deployed a **Flask-based web API** to serve predictions and trigger **real-time notifications**.
- Automated **email alerts** for clients when spending anomalies or thresholds are detected.
- Integrated forecasting data with the production **PostgreSQL database** to update dashboards and planning tools.

## üöÄ Technology Stack

### üß† ML/DS Tools
- scikit-learn, XGBoost, Facebook Prophet, LightGBM,
- Pandas, NumPy for feature engineering and preprocessing  
- Time-series modeling: seasonal decomposition, exponential smoothing (ETS), ARIMA, Prophet  
- Deep learning: RNN, LSTM for sequential trend prediction  
- Tree-based models: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees  
- Model evaluation: cross-validation

### üñ•Ô∏è DevOps & Backend
- **GitLab CI/CD** for automation and testing  
- **Docker** for containerized deployment  
- **Azure Cloud** for hosting and data storage  
- **Flask + REST API** for real-time interaction  

## Outcomes

- Improved **forecast accuracy** for ad spend by over 20% compared to baseline methods.
- Reduced **budget overshoot** incidents by enabling smarter daily spend thresholds.
- Enabled **hands-free campaign monitoring** for clients with low technical overhead.
