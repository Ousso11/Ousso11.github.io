## Teaching Assistant Experience

During my studies, I served as a **teaching assistant** for multiple courses across computer science, mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering. In addition to supporting lectures, labs, and tutorials, I also administered oral exams and graded written assessments. This experience deepened my understanding of core scientific and engineering concepts, sharpened my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, and strengthened my skills in academic evaluation and mentorship.
